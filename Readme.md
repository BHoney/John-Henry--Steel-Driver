*John Henry - Steel Driver* is a simple side scrolling beat'em up game in the vein of Streets of Rage and Final Fight being made for the itch.io hosted game jam "[#PDJam](itch.io/jam/the-public-domain-jamâ€Ž)". Beginning on May 17th and ending May 24th, PDJAM will consist of creating a game using public domain character in a week.

This particular game will star John Henry, a large gentleman who was said to be born with two twenty pound hammers in his hand and defeated a steam engine. John will do a lot of dropping from ceilings, following blinking arrows that say "GO!", and hitting colorful enemies with one or both of these aformentioned twenty pound steel driving hammers.

## What's The Engine?

Due to this being our first game, *John Henry - Steel Driver* will not be written from scratch using code to create an engine, but instead built using the Game Maker Studio engine. This engine was chosen due to it's ease of access and it's relatively small learing curve. Additionally, seeing as we're not making the world's next great 3D character action game, sticking to an engine that wholely focuses on 2D as opposed to adapting one such as Unity feels to be the best option.
